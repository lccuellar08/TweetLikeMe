# Project Title

Tweet Like Me is an end-to-end pipeline that given a specified twitter user, will download their tweets, format them, train a model, and generate texts meant to simulate the user's tweets. The model is an LSTM architecture that uses the user's tweets as the corpus for training the Word2Vec embeddings.
